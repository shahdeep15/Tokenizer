This is a simple C program that takes a string as an argument from the command line and tokenizes it. 

Please take a look at tokenizer.pdf to view the project description. 
tokenizer.c has the code. testcases.txt has some testcases when the program was run. 
readme.pdf is a file that explains how we developed the code and what it does.
